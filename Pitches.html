<p><b>Pitch 1: Natural gas pipeline incidents </b></p>

<p>In the last decade the U.S. has experienced a natural gas boom mainly because of the discovery of large shale gas reserves. But it also partly due to the technological advances in hydraulic fracturing — or fracking — that have allowed the exploitation of natural gas to become a commercially viable option.</p>

<p><a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/pipeline-incident-data-natural-gas-distribution-incident-data-january-2010-to-pr">These</a> <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/pipeline-incident-data-natural-gas-distribution-incident-data-march-2004-to-dece">datasets</a> <a href="http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/pipeline-incident-data-natural-gas-distribution-incident-data-mid-1984-to-februa">from the</a> Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) provide a list of incident reports from 1984 to 2013. I would like to see how incidents have changed over the years. I believe the data will show an increase in incidents simply because the mileage of pipelines has increased. But I also expect that the type of incidents would have changed as industry practices change. I think there is a wealth of information in these datasets. Here are some questions that I’d like to get answers for:</p>

<p>1. Which operator has had the highest number of incidents?</p>

<p>2. Which state has had the most incidents/per mile of pipeline?</p>

<p>3. Which PHMSA department has the most incidents/ mile of pipeline? PHMSA has offices that take care of the southwest, central, western and eastern regions. Each office is responsible for conducting safety reviews. If one office has a large share of incident reports it might indicate sloppiness on PHMSA’s part.</p>

<p><b>Pitch 2: Fracking and earthquakes </b></p>

<p>Seismologists and environmentalists have long been warning that fracking can lead to earthquakes. I’d like to test this theory out using data from <a href="http://service.iris.edu/fdsnws/event/docs/1/builder/">IRIS</a> and a <a href="http://service.iris.edu/fdsnws/event/docs/1/builder/">state fracking report</a>. Combining these two data sets to see if there has been a rise in earthquakes reported that matches the fracking boom might make a stronger case for this theory. </p>
